When it comes to content, video is king. It is the most consumed content on the web. If you had to choose from a range of media types to get a message across, a video should always be your first consideration. Visual communication is the top tier form of getting your messaging to stick. While graphics and copy can make the difference between a website visit and a sale, video can go even further. Why not have the best of both worlds?  

Simply making your hero a video or designing your hero with a graphic overlayed with some copy is the typical approach to homepage hero sections. There is a way to have both and it involves Magnific Popup, a jQuery plugin that displays content when an HTML element is clicked. In our example, the hero image and overlaying copy is still prominent. Our Call-to-Action (CTA), however, is a button. This button does not simply take them to another page with more copy and graphics, it opens a popup video. In this scenario, you can maintain your hero image and overlaying text and provide the option for website visitors to view a video further describing your product or service.
